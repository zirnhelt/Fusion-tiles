⚛ FUSION TILES ⚛

Match tiles. Fuse matter. Advance the table.

---

Fusion Tiles is a match-3 puzzle game built around the real periodic table of
elements — all 118 of them, from Hydrogen (H) to Oganesson (Og).

Swap adjacent tiles to line up three or more identical elements. Matched tiles
fuse into heavier elements, pushing you further up the periodic table. Every
move counts — run out and the game ends.

---

HOW TO PLAY

→ Click a tile, then click an adjacent tile to swap them
→ Match 3 or more of the same element to fuse them
→ Fused tiles merge into the next heavier element on the table
→ Score points and earn bonus moves with longer matches
→ Game over when you run out of moves
