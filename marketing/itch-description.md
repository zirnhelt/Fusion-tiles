Hydrogen is where everyone starts.
Oganesson is where no one has been.

Fusion Tiles is a match-3 puzzle built on the real periodic table — all 118
elements, from H to Og. Swap adjacent tiles to line up three or more of the
same element. They fuse. Heavier tiles take their place. The board keeps
evolving, and so does the challenge.

You start with 40 moves. Every match spends one, but longer matches and chain
reactions earn them back. Stay alive long enough and you'll watch the board
shift from light gases like Helium and Neon into copper, iron, krypton —
and beyond.

The further you go, the harder the board gets to read.
That's the point.

────────────────────────────────────────

HOW IT WORKS

Click a tile → click an adjacent tile → swap → match 3+ → fuse.

Longer matches earn bonus moves:
  4-match  → +2 moves
  5-match  → +4 moves
  6+ match → +6 moves
  Cascade  → +2 moves per chain reaction

Set up cascades and watch the board clear itself. Those are the moments.

WHEN YOU'RE STUCK

💡 Hint    — reveals a valid move for 3 seconds
🔀 Shuffle — scrambles the board
☢ Nuke    — full board reset (last resort)
